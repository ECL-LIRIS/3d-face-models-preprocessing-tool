# 3D MODELS PROCESSING TOOL
The tool was written as an integral part of my PhD thesis, entitled: "Processing and analysis of 2.5D face models for non-rigid mapping based face recognition using differential geometry tools" at Ecole Centrale de Lyon. 
The application allows to process 2.5D/3D face models using pre-programmed algorithms and is distributed under 

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE ver. 3 

If You would like to participate in the development of the tool, please contact me.
